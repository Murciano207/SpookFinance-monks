# Yogi Monks
The participants of the Yogi community are central to the success of the platform. This is why 10% of the entire YOGI supply has been reserved for  community contributors. 

# How to participate

- One time tasks: This repository will work as an aggregator of tasks. The team will continually open new tasks with a YOGI bounty attached to them.
- Recurring gigs: After a Yogi monk has earned enough trust in the community, they might be eligible to take part in larger or recurring gigs. 

If there is an activity that could provide value to Yogi and you cannot find a relevant task, please open one. The team will either accept your suggested task and assign it a YOGI bounty, or close it.

# Feedback
If you have any way to improve the program, please reach out. This program will evolve through community discussion and governance.
